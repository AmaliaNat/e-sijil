What the project does
- This is the first website I've fully developed and designed for a project during my Diploma studies. E-sijil is an initiative designed 
to automatically generate certificates for school events. The website allows user to generate and print certificates, keep track and manage the
certificates they had generated and add signature of school caunselor.


Why the project is useful
- E-sijil provides a faster alternative to generate certificates. The old traditional way requires a person in charge to enter the information
of every certificates receiver manually using software such Adobe Photoshop or Microsoft Words. This process is hasty and time consuming. E-sijil 
provides solutions by allowing certicates to be generated in just few clicks.
